// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
// programe 1#
//Author: name is huzaifa;
// Date: 21/04/24
// Store my favorite number in a variable
var favoriteNumber = 88;
var message = "This is my favorite number " + favoriteNumber;
console.log(message);
// programe 2#
//Author: name is huzaifa;
// Date: 21/04/24
// Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
var personName = "\t\n john ellia \n\t";
console.log("original: " + personName);
console.log("stripped: " + personName.trim());
