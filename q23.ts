// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

// let car = 'subaru';

// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

// console.log(car == 'subaru')

// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

let five: number = 5;
let ten: number = 10;
// this is true condition
console.log("five is equal to 5");
console.log(five === 5);

console.log("ten is equal to 10");
console.log(ten === 10);

console.log("ten is not equal to 5");
console.log(ten !== 5);

console.log("ten is greater then 5");
console.log(ten > 5);

console.log("five is less then 10");
console.log(five < 10);

// this is false condition

console.log("five is not equal to 5");
console.log(five !== 5);

console.log("ten is not equal to 10");
console.log(ten !== 10);

console.log("ten is  equal to 5");
console.log(ten === 5);

console.log("ten is less then 5");
console.log(ten < 5);

console.log("five is greater then 10");
console.log(five > 10);
