// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
var animal = ["dog", "cat", "cow", "ship"];
for (var _i = 0, animal_1 = animal; _i < animal_1.length; _i++) {
    var oneAnimal = animal_1[_i];
    console.log("".concat(oneAnimal, "this paid a wafadar"));
}
console.log("cow is a great paid");
